Test game for elixir backend game server.
This game is a tile based game where a randomly
generated party is created and scattered on a board
you can then move the party members around and have
them attack each other.

From a programming prospective this is mothing amazing.
It was also writen at 4am so excuse any poor spelling
or naming decisions.
